        ques: "Are infrared thermometers accurate?",
        ans: `Infrared (IR) thermometers offer the same level of accuracy and reliability as that of a rectal or oral thermometer. However, it is also essential to understand that the accuracy depends on how and where you use these thermometers. Make sure to refer to the manufacturer's guidelines and instructions for proper use.`,
      },
      {
        ques: "Are infrared thermometers safe?",
        ans: `Clinical infrared thermometers are completely safe to use on everyone - babies, children, and adults as long as you don't point the laser beam into their eyes. These non-contact devices also allow measuring the temperature of humans from a safe distance.`,
      },
      {
        ques: "What temperatures do infrared thermometers measure?",
        ans: `The temperature measurement range of infrared thermometers varies according to its type. It provides fast clinical accurate precise reading with less than 1 sec measurement time. Maximum allowable error - ±0.2℃ in the range of (35℃ - 42℃) ±0.3℃ outside the range of (35℃ - 42℃).`,
      },
      {
        ques: "What are its memory features and temperature measurement units?",
        ans: `You can store up to 32 sets of readings and recall them at any time. An intelligent shutdown feature supports auto shutdown for power saving. This FDA and CE certified thermometer measures temperature in Celsius (℃) as well as Fahrenheit (°F) measuring units. Long press ‘SET’ key 3 times. Each time for more than 3 seconds. When the screen flashes F3, use arrow keys to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Once selected, press ‘SET’ again.`,
      },
      {
        ques: "How to use a non-contact infrared thermometer?",
        ans: `Follow the steps below to measure the surface temperature of a subject using a non-contact infrared thermometer:
          a. Turn ON the IR thermometer and press & hold the trigger for the laser beam to appear.
          b. Point the laser beam in the direction of the subject you want to collect the temperature readings for.
          c. Make sure that the laser beam is stable and is pointing at the central location.
          d. If possible, stay as close to the subject as possible for accurate readings.
          e. Press & hold the trigger while the thermometer records the subject's temperature.
          f. The recorded temperature will get displayed on the thermometer's digital display.
          g. Note down the readings and turn OFF the device after use.`,
      },
      {
        ques: "Can infrared thermometers work through glass?",
        ans: `No. infrared thermometers cannot measure the temperature accurately if there is glass, liquids, or any transparent surface between 
          the subject and thermometer. The temperature values displayed in such conditions are of a transparent surface and not the subject.

        Light from heat lamps and phototherapy lights has been reported to skew the readings. The high intensity of light emitted
        from these sources masks the small changes in light transmission from the probe. The remedy is to shield the probe from 
        the ambient light by black paper (e.g.carbon paper) or black polythene or aluminum foil.`,

        ques: "What are pulse oximeters used for?",
        ans: `Pulse oximeters provide regular observation and monitoring of the oxygen saturation of haemoglobin in arterial blood. These devices
        are generally used in hospitals, medical clinics, operating rooms as well as in homes for patients suffering from asthma, 
       COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and congestive heart failure. Individuals with serious respiratory issues should have
        their SpO2 (or saturation of peripheral oxygen) level checked on a regular basis.`,

      {
        ques: "How does a pulse oximeter work?",
        ans: `A pulse oximeter just needs to be clipped on to your fingertip. The probe passes two types of light through the finger – infrared and
        red. These are transmitted from the probe through the body and into a light detector on the other side. If the haemoglobin is saturated 
       with oxygen then it will absorb more of the infrared light and if there is less oxygen then more of the red light will be absorbed. This is 
       converted into a digital value which is displayed on the pulse oximeter’s screen.`,
      },
      {
        ques: "How can I determine the accuracy of the pulse oximeter?",
        ans: `Most pulse oximeters have a visual representation of the pulse intensity as well as a digital display of the pulse. The pulse display
        should be within three beats per minute of the display on the cardiac monitor. The bar pulse display or pulse waveform must cover 
        half of the total display for an accurate reading. Differences greater than this will not reflect accurate oxygen saturation values
        because the probe is not detecting the arterial pulsations adequately or accurately.`,
