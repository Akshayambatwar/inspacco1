With the lightweight advantage thin brick can be installed in numerous places where regular brick can not.  Regular brick requires some type of footing or support to be constructed on and is typically used outside of a home or commercial building.

Although ceramic and porcelain tile are both made from clay and other minerals, the clay used to make porcelain tile is more refined and fired at much higher temperatures than ceramic tile. As a result, porcelain tile is extremely dense and less porous so it’s more resistant to moisture, stains, and water absorption. Although ceramic tiles are less expensive and highly recommended for interior floors and walls, porcelain tiles are more desirable due to its durability and resistance to chipping and scratching, especially for areas that endure heavy traffic.",

You can permanently adhere tile to concrete walking pads to create stunning garden stepping stones. But if you decide to use ceramic tile outdoors, be sure these tiles meet slip-resistance minimum requirements. Exterior tiles have a surface texture that helps make them slip resistant. Top-quality tile manufacturers make special outdoor tile that has a slightly gritty surface, even though the tile is glazed. ",
